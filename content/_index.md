Joey Lynch
==========

Hi! This site is a collection of various thoughts or problems that I have
worked on over the years that I thought might be worth writing down and
keeping track of. Most of the content should involve computers, but it may also
dive into economics as well.

I enjoy working on various open source projects typically in
the distributed systems space (proxies, databases, service platforms, etc ...)
but sometimes I just hack on [projects]({{< ref projects >}}) for fun.

I also sometimes write about computers either somewhat [formally]({{< ref
publications >}}) or more for [fun]({{< ref posts >}}). Occasionally I even
get to give [presentations]({{< ref talks >}}) about what I work on.

Recent Posts
============

Some recent posts I've written are available below. If you want to see them
all head over to [posts]({{< ref posts >}}) or check out one of my
[series]({{< ref tags >}}).
