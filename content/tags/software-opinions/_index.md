title: Software Opinions
---

Sometimes I opine on software. This series collects some of my opinions into
one place for the curious to peruse. Please remember these posts represent
my good-faith opinions and therefore may change over time as I learn new
perspectives or gather new evidence. I am frequently wrong, sometimes I am
blatantly [wrong on the internet](https://xkcd.com/386/), but please bear with
me as I learn that.
