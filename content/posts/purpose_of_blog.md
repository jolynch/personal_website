I figured it was time to start a proper personal/tech blog given how much I
enjoy writing about the crazy fun and wierd distributed systems problems that
I work on.

Initially I am planning on writing up my current rants on high performance
software systems as understood through food service analogies, but I imagine
it'll evolve from there to just talking about cool systems problems I work on
every day.
