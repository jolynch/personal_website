This post is going to be a bit shorter and less researched than normal, but I
have had a few folks ask me to write down my thoughts on this matter so here
it goes. I believe that:

> Not only are there 10x Engineers, there are Infinity Engineers

My experience is limited to Software Engineering so I'll only extend my claim
that far, but the idea may be more generally applicable.

# What is an Infinity Engineer?

Engineers solve problems, and as much as Managers may want to believe that they
can hire a single DevSecOpsDB engineer who possesses every skillset walking in
the door, problems usually require slightly distinct skillsets to solve. I
think that Managers _really_ want a *team* of Infinity Engineers.

Infinity Engineers are capable of solving nearly any problem together because
they possess the following traits:
1. A passion for learning and understanding the underlying problems.
2. A passion for tool-use and desire to learn new tools that help them solve
   problems.
3. The ability to identify and quickly acquire skills required to solve the
   problem.
4. The ability to recognize when learning a skill would take too long and has
   built a support network of other experts and channels where they can ask
   for help or delegate.

I call these engineers "Infinity Engineers" because when an adequate
engineer is assigned a problem that is beyond their capability, the problem
does not get solved. When you assign an Infinity Engineer to the task the
problem get's solved. The second engineer is infinitely more valuable since
the problem goes from zero (not getting solved) to non-zero (getting solved).

## Are Infinity Engineers Rare?

Where I differ significantly from the 10x crowd are I don't think Infinity
Engineers are super rare, most engineers can be one if they are given the space
to learn and ask for help without fear. In fact, I think that the very nature
of the Engineering field attracts tinkerers and hackers (the good kind), and
those groups usually have the two components that are hard to teach:
curiosity and the ability to acquire skills.

Managers can help their engineers become Infinity Engineers by rewarding
curiosity and problem solving over playing it safe (fighting status quo bias).
They can strive to build teams of complementary skillsets that inherently give
a forum for asking for help with safety and make sure that they set context
tat devs have room to ask for help and collaborate.

Also, it's worth noting that recognizing someone is out of their depth and
encouraging them to exercise trait 4 *helps* them become an Infinity Engineer.

## Do you consider yourself an Infinity Engineer?

Not yet as I think I still have a lot of skills to acquire, tools to learn,
experts to learn from, and support networks to build. I do believe I possess
the curiosity and ability to acquire skills, and I currently work at a great
company with a great manager that gives me room to grow in this area.

We shall see.
