I recently read [The Deficit Myth](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/0r7_ygEACAAJ?hl=en)
and I particularly enjoyed the insight that inflation comes from consumer spending
on supply-limited goods, _not printing money_. Put differently, under relatively
constant demand, if a consumer has more money they will accept a higher price.

This realization has some interesting consequences for federal monetary policy:

1. Printing money does not cause inflation, it matters more who gets to spend
   that money.
2. Spending money to create supply only causes inflation on the materials that
   supplier requires.
3. Tax cuts is functionally equivalent to printing money and handing it directly
   to certain people.

Under this insight the past decade of lose money but [low inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=EqRD) in the consumer price index ([CPI](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)) makes
sense if that money supply did not primarily flow to consumers.

## There has actually been inflation

Most of the money that has been created in the past twenty years via tax cuts,
defense spending, and government guaranteed loans (mortgage guarantees and
education loans in particular) has flowed to generally wealthier people.

Rich people don't really compete for gallons of milk, they compete for (in
rough order of wealth):

* Art
* Yachts
* Land in desirable areas
* New Cars
* Higher Education (College)

Average prices on all of these goods have increased, but just like
measuring average latency of websites doesn't reveal much information to
really see the inflation we want to look at the tail of the distribution.

Unfortunately I can't find any actual price distribution data, just a bunch of
averages. We can try to create some of the tail by looking at 
And boy has the tail of the price distribution seen inflation.
